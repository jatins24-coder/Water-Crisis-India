      <h1>The Water Crisis in India: A Nation on the Brink</h1>

      <p><strong>Water scarcity</strong> is no longer a distant threat—it is a present-day emergency in India. As the world's second-most populous country, India's demand for water has grown exponentially in the past few decades. However, the supply has not kept up, and the nation now finds itself facing a crisis that threatens the health, livelihoods, and future of millions.</p>

      <h2>Why Is India Running Out of Water?</h2>
      <p>Multiple factors contribute to India's water crisis:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Over-extraction of groundwater:</strong> 85% of rural India relies on groundwater, but levels are rapidly falling.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor water management:</strong> Leaky infrastructure, unplanned urbanization, and lack of policies worsen distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> More than 70% of surface water is contaminated by sewage and industrial waste.</li>
        <li><strong>Climate change:</strong> Irregular monsoons and droughts are becoming more frequent and intense.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Impact on People</h2>
      <p>In 2019, Chennai became the first major Indian city to run out of water. Taps ran dry. Residents queued for hours. Tankers delivered water at steep costs. Unfortunately, this scenario is not unique. Cities like Bengaluru, Delhi, and Hyderabad are now listed among global hotspots for future water scarcity.</p>

      <blockquote>
        "About 200,000 Indians die every year due to inadequate access to safe water." — NITI Aayog, 2018
      </blockquote>

      <h2>The Rural and Agricultural Crisis</h2>
      <p>Farmers are among the worst hit. Agriculture uses nearly 80% of India’s water, much of it inefficiently. Droughts have pushed many farmers into debt and despair, contributing to the tragic rise in farmer suicides.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>India’s water crisis is not an isolated issue—it intersects with health, food security, economic stability, and human rights. Urgent action is needed now before this crisis becomes irreversible.</p>
